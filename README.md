# DriveScanner
Scans local drives with BFS traversal
## Why
I have a 4 external hard drives except 2 internal, and sometimes it needs to be cleaned up so bad.
## What it does
Scans the file system tree, searches for file duplicates and then create a text report about files and directories sorted by size.
## Usage
If you use a CLI, it has a built-in `--usage` command. 
GUI is simple to understand
